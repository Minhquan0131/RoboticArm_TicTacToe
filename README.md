# RoboticArm_TicTacToe
An Advanced Robotic Arm Implementation for Playing Tic-Tac-Toe



## Project Description

The turn-based game (tic tac toe) can be played by designing a mechanical structure and programming a robotic arm. This project shows how robotics and artificial intelligence can be used to develop a clever system that can play Tic-Tac-Toe strategically. The motion equations are derived using Lagrangian mechanics.

## Features

- Calculates inverse kinematics for accurate arm movement.
- Draws both 'X' and 'O' symbols on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Supports multiple grid sizes and difficulty levels.
