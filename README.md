# RoboticArm_TicTacToe
An Advanced Robotic Arm Implementation for Playing Tic-Tac-Toe



## Project Description

Design mechanical and program an advanced robotic arm play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This project showcases the integration of robotics and AI to create an intelligent system capable of making strategic moves on the Tic-Tac-Toe board. The project also includes a complete mathematical model of the SCARA robot, as well as dynamic simulation and servo actuator dynamics. The equations of motion are derived using Lagrangian mechanics.

## Features

- Calculates inverse kinematics for accurate arm movement.
- Draws both 'X' and 'O' symbols on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Supports multiple grid sizes and difficulty levels.
